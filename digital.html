      <p class="paragraph">This is my first Arduino-based, Bluetooth-controlled RC car. It is controlled by a smart phone application.
      In this project i used a bluettoth wireless technology to control our robot car which is a very simple communication system.
      The remote in this project is an android device which has Bluetooth
      feature in it</P>

        Facial recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their face. It captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on the person's facial details.
       The face detection process is an essential step as it detects and locates human faces in images and videos.
       The face capture process transforms analog information (a face) into a set of digital information (data) based on the person's facial features.
       The face match process verifies if two faces belong to the same  person.
